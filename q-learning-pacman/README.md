This project implements a Pacman game using the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm. The game features:
- A 15x15 grid world
- Dynamic food and ghost spawning
- Intelligent ghost movement
- Real-time visualization of the training process

- Q-Learning Algorithm: The agent learns to maximize rewards by exploring the environment.
- Dynamic Environment: Food and ghosts are dynamically generated to keep the game challenging.
- Visualization: The game state is visualized using Pygame, with real-time updates.
