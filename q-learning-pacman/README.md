# Pacman Q-Learning Project
This project is an assignment of course CDS524

## Project Description
This project implements a Pacman game using the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm. The game features:
- A 15x15 grid world
- Dynamic food and ghost spawning
- Intelligent ghost movement
- Real-time visualization of the training process

## Features
- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: The agent learns to maximize rewards by exploring the environment.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Food and ghosts are dynamically generated to keep the game challenging.
- **Visualization**: The game state is visualized using Pygame, with real-time updates.
